<h2>1. WASTE Chrome Extension</h2>

Web Application Security Tester (WASTE), a custom-made tool, is a Google Chrome Extension with the intent of allowing web developers easier understanding of their current web application’s security standing.

<h3>1.1 Motivation for WASTE</h3>

Many tools for testing web vulnerabilities are available online. Each tool has their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The idea of WASTE came about when we felt that security tools today are pretty fragmented as one would require knowledge on operating multiple tools to cover a broad scope of attacks. On top of that, tools which are currently available require a casual web developer a lot of know-how to operate them. Thus, we wish to create a Chrome Extension which would allow these web developers to find out more about their web application’s security.
